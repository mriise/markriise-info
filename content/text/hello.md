# My name is Melanie!

## TODO this website is old and i wanna make it staticly rendered
I enjoy researching low level protocols and building browser-native packages!

#### Active Research
- [LibP2P](https://libp2p.io/) communication in-browser
- [Rust MultiHash](https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multihash) blake3
- IPFS based voluntary CDN (with pure p2p swarm management)

(website rendered entirely in-browser with preact and htm!)
